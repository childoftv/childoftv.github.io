I joined forces with relative rails veterans [dickey.xxx](https://github.com/dickeyxxx) and [amdtech](https://github.com/amdtech) to form team [Attested Development](http://railsrumble.com/entries/134-attested-development) in the [2012 Rails Rumble](http://blog.railsrumble.com/).

Our submission [arss.io](arss.io) (**A** **R**eally **S**imple **S**tuff **S**yndicator) is a way to aggregate multiple feeds of data from a range of services and package the combined items into a summarized feed of high quality 'parcels'. Jeff created a great [write up post on his blog](http://dickey.xxx/arss)

I played the role of the front end and demi-product guy and Jeff and Aaron conquered the core architecture with surprising easy in ruby. Their development efficiency drove me to take and complete the [Rails For Zombies](http://railsforzombies.org/) course with the intent of learning more ruby/rails in the near future.

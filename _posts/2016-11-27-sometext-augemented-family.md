_Some text on 2016 life updates and 2016..._


[Jenny](http://donotlick.com) and I have been overjoyed and extremely fortunate to spend half of 2016 with our very own escapist [empathy machine](https://www.ted.com/talks/chris_milk_how_virtual_reality_can_create_the_ultimate_empathy_machine).

The new layer of reality that Scarlett (Born in June) has brought into our lives has been helpful through the start of [some](http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/20/media/donald-trump-snl-equal-time/) [very](http://fortune.com/2016/11/18/ivanka-trump-shinzo-abe/) [worrying](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/22/nasa-earth-donald-trump-eliminate-climate-change-research?CMP=twt_gu) [times](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/11/21/1602803/-Trump-invites-network-executives-anchors-and-reporters-to-a-f-ing-firing-squad). Hope is always close when you see the world in the innocent eyes of a child.

There are fears nonetheless. We feel keenly the duty to ensure that Scarlett a) has a world to grow up in and b) has a world that is well fit to be enjoyed by the people in it. We're very well aware that our concerns need to look far beyond our own family also: I like the term "participatory global society" as a 3 word summary of my 2 cents.

Working at [BlippAR](http://blippar.com) in SF since April has been a different but complementary layer of my life.

We're building a visual browser which [augments your reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byGdr7tV2sY) in [glorious interactive 3D](https://blippar.com/fr/resources/blog/2016/11/22/covent-garden-becomes-worlds-first-augmented-reality-retail-destination-powered-blippar/).

Honestly, the experience has been truly inspiring and it's the largest and most global company I have worked for in a fulltime role. Those who know me know I have a [thing](http://sometext.com/leaving-symmetry-labs.html) for building [mashed-up](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/7039893.stm) [weird](http://idleworship.com/) "boundary" [media experiences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyScDPE8drE) that blur [function](https://github.com/childoftv/as3-websocket-server) and [form](https://vimeo.com/104574452). I don't know if I can call the zone a "medium," but if it was one it would be mine. At any rate, I have never felt so at home or so empowered to explore the boundaries of the zone as I have here.

If this sounds cool to you then ask me about it; we're [aggressively hiring](https://blippar.com/en/careers/) senior (and occasionally junior) talent

I suppose 2016 had too many layers. Far too many for one post anyway. There's a [lot](http://www.wsj.com/articles/ceos-no-longer-say-people-are-our-greatest-asset-according-to-new-report-1479412130) that needs to be [done](http://countercurrentnews.com/2016/07/leonardo-dicaprio-helps-pull-2-6-trillion-fossil-fuel-investments/) in 2017. Next year I'll write more and do more. Emphasis, as ever, on the latter.

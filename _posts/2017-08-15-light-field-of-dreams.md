At the end of the month I will be joining [Lytro](lytro.com) as Engineering Manager for Cloud Operations on the amazing team that [achieved this](http://blog.lytro.com/cloud-processing-for-light-field-data/). 

Lytro have in recent years pivoted from their [consumer light field cameras](https://www.lytro.com/press/releases/lytro-inc-unveils-the-worlds-first-consumer-light-field-camera) towards larger scale use cases in cinema and VR. 

The core approach is to use a [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field) to represent captured light instead of the more standard [scalar field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field) pixel grid. The data sizes are large and the cloud technology needed is intimidating, but the technique is incredibly powerful. Lytro already demonstrated "focusing after the fact" in their consumer hardware, and much more is possible.

I am thrilled to work closer to entertainment again and working on capture, VFX, VR and cloud processing technology is truly a dream come true.

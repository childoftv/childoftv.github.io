<p class="lead"><img src="/assets/meSF.jpg" style="display: block; float: left; margin-right: 30px"/>Hey there! I am a passionate product-focused developer with management and usability experience. I am fascinated by the boundaries of new mediums and permanently look for opportunities to connect technologies in new ways. </p>

I grew up in London, England and Holywood, Northern Ireland. I studied at St. John's College, Cambridge and Manchester University, where I graduated in Computer Science. In Summer 2010 I moved to San Francisco to live with my now wife Jennifer.
